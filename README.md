# ProjectManagerAPP
Our Project Manager APP is an Android Application that integrates the functionality of a calendar, a chat room and a task progress tracking module. We learn that it can be difficult or even struggling to deal with multiple projects at the same time, so in order to help people better organize and manage their projects, we came up with this app. It is a great application for students and employees who need to work on multiple group projects in parallel. Our app consolidates details(e.g. due dates, group chats, and current progress) of all projects into a single place where users can easily access and communicate.  

The http server for this application can be found at https://github.com/Huqicheng/HttpServer.
